# Data Science Gun Violence Report
## Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to look at recent gun violence crimes in the United States. To look at if there are any correlations between these acts of violence such as being more frequent in certain cities or any other strange occurrences in the data. 

## Selection of Data 

The data group I selected for this project is: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonmobley/united-states-gun-violence-data-20142022 

This data is gun violence from January 1st , 2014 up until June 15th, 2022. It includes any violent gun crimes within this time span. So even if it was an accident it is counted within the dataset. It also includes data from these crimes even if no one was killed, it counts injuries and deaths in separate categories. It also provides the location of the incident as well as the date it occurred, along with the incident number to validate that these crimes really did occur.
